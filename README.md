# ESP32 Web App Controller

This project demonstrates an advanced web server running on an ESP32 microcontroller. It allows users to control and monitor the ESP32 via a web-based interface.

## Features
- Web-based control panel for ESP32
- Real-time status updates
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- Easy integration with sensors and actuators

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ESP32 development board
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Required libraries (see code for details)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/minhhieugma/esp32-web-app-controller.git
   ```
2. Open `AdvancedWebServer.ino` in your Arduino IDE.
3. Configure your WiFi credentials in the code.
4. Upload the sketch to your ESP32 board.
5. Access the web interface using the ESP32's IP address.
